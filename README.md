# Introduction of ResBIM dataset
Welcome to **Res**idential Unit **BIM** dataset (**ResBIM** dataset), this is a totally PUBLIC dataset.

ResBIM is a synthetic dataset created by CNN and rule-based algorithms, designed specifically for research in BIM automation and 2D-to-BIM reconstruction. The dataset comprises 1000+ paired samples, each consisting of a fully parametric 3D BIM (RVT format) and its corresponding annotated 2D floor plan. All data were generated and validated using automated workflows in Autodesk Revit to ensure both consistency and scalability. ResBIM is intended for a wide range of applications, including multi-platform BIM interoperability, serving as a foundation for benchmarking 2D-to-BIM algorithms, and the development of computer vision models for architectural analysis.
